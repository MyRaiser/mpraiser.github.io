# Python

> Beautiful is better than ugly.
> Explicit is better than implicit.
> Simple is better than complex.
> Complex is better than complicated.
> Flat is better than nested.
> Sparse is better than dense.
> Readability counts.
> Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
> Although practicality beats purity.
> Errors should never pass silently.
> Unless explicitly silenced.
> In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
> There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
> Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
> Now is better than never.
> Although never is often better than *right* now.
> If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
> If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
> Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

## Motivation
比“怎么做”更重要的是“为什么这么做”，比“写完一串程序执行序列”更重要的是“对问题建立一个正确地抽象”。

## 准备工作

### 安装环境

`PATH`

### `python` 与 `pip`

## Helloworld

```py
print("hello, world!")
```

## 变量与类型

在`python`中创建一个变量或给变量赋值非常简单：

```py
x = 1
x = "helloworld"
```

不需要声明和定义变量的类型

`python`是一种动态类型语言

强类型

```
x = "5"
y = 5
print("5" + 5)
```

鸭子类型（duck-typing）

type hint

### 可变对象与不可变对象

## 函数与类

多范式

函数式编程指南

## 迭代器

无限大的流

## 导入模块
